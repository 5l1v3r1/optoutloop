# optoutloop
flood an optout loop of a fake spam opt out page

the goal here is to get a person who gives you a fake optout page the message that it's trivial to overflow their services...Leave an issue if you wish to see some modifications for this like a means to conditionally do other stuff :P

todo: iterate through a LIST of optouts to work with
